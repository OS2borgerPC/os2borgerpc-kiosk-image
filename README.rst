OS2borgerPC: Kiosk/Server Image
===============================

This folder contains the source code for building a modified Ubuntu
Kiosk/Server image (.iso file) for connecting kiosk installations to the
OS2borgerPC admin system.

This work was commissioned by Aarhus Kommune for their OS2display
solution. The image contains an install script for the OS2borgerPC
client as well as some utilities to easily connect to Wi-Fi in
case no ethernet is available during installation.

Read the documentation for this project in docs/ or at
`Read The Docs <https://os2borgerpc-server-image.readthedocs.io/>`_.

The system was prepared by Magenta Aps (https://www.magenta.dk) and is part of the
OS2borgerPC project.
