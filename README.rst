This folder contains the source code for building a modified Ubuntu
Server image (.iso file) for connection server installations to the
OS2borgerPC admin system.

This work was commissioned by Aarhus Kommune for their OS2display
solution. The image contains an install script for the OS2borgerPC
client as well as some utilities to easily connect to the network in
case no Internet is available during installation.

The OS2borgerPC Server Image is free software, and you are welcome to
use, study, modify and distribute it under the terms of version 3 of the
GNU General Public License.
